### MetaMask Snaps Introduction
Snaps is a system that allows developers to safely build and expand the capabilities of MetaMask. It is a program that is run in an isolated environment with a limited set of capabilities, that can customize and modify MetaMask's wallet experience for end users. For example, a snap can add new APIs to MetaMask thus adding support for different blockchains or modify existing functionalities using internal APIs.

Additional information can be found [here](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html).
